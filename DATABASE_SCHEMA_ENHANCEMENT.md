# Database Schema Enhancement Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the enhanced database schema implementation for The Gladiator League fantasy football application. The enhancement introduces temporal tracking, performance optimization, and comprehensive audit trails for robust data management.

## Enhanced Tables

### 1. Enhanced team_rosters Table
**Purpose:** Track current and historical roster states with temporal fields.

**New Fields:**
- `current_week`: Current week number for temporal tracking
- `is_current`: Boolean flag for current roster state
- `added_date`: Timestamp when player was added
- `removed_date`: Timestamp when player was removed
- `roster_status`: Current status (active, bench, ir, taxi)
- `last_updated`: Last modification timestamp

**Indexes:** Composite indexes on (season_id, week, is_current) for optimal temporal queries.

### 2. player_roster_history Table
**Purpose:** Complete audit trail of all roster movements with timestamps.

**Key Features:**
- Full transaction history tracking
- FAAB cost tracking for waiver claims
- Trade tracking with from/to team references
- Comprehensive action type classification

**Fields:**
- `team_id`, `player_id`, `season_id`, `week`
- `action_type`: add, drop, trade, waiver_claim, free_agent_pickup
- `transaction_id`: Sleeper API transaction reference
- `from_team_id`, `to_team_id`: For trade tracking
- `transaction_date`, `faab_cost`, `notes`

### 3. player_availability_cache Table
**Purpose:** Optimized cache for fast player availability queries.

**Performance Benefits:**
- Eliminates need for complex joins during player searches
- Pre-calculated availability status
- Conference-aware ownership tracking
- Waiver priority caching

**Fields:**
- `player_id`, `season_id`, `week`
- `is_available`, `owned_by_team_id`, `owned_by_conference_id`
- `roster_status`, `waiver_priority`
- `last_transaction_date`, `cache_updated_at`

### 4. sync_status Table
**Purpose:** Track data synchronization state and prevent conflicts.

**Monitoring Features:**
- Sync operation tracking by type and conference
- Performance metrics (duration, records processed, API calls)
- Error tracking and reporting
- Scheduled sync management

**Fields:**
- `sync_type`: rosters, matchups, players, standings, transactions
- `conference_id`, `season_id`, `week`
- `sync_status`: pending, in_progress, completed, failed
- Performance and error tracking fields

### 5. View Tables for Optimized Queries

#### current_rosters_view
Pre-joined view of current roster states with team and conference information.

#### available_players_view
Optimized view for player availability searches with injury status and NFL team info.

#### multi_team_ownership_view
Track players owned across multiple teams/conferences with ownership counts.

## Enhanced Existing Tables

### players Table Enhancements
- `is_current_data`: Boolean flag for current vs historical data
- `last_updated`: API sync timestamp
- `created_at`: Record creation timestamp
- `data_version`: Version tracking for data changes

### seasons Table Enhancements
- `current_week`: Current week tracking
- `regular_season_weeks`, `playoff_weeks`: Season structure
- `season_start_date`, `season_end_date`: Temporal boundaries
- `draft_completed`: Draft status tracking

### conferences Table Enhancements
- `current_week`: Conference-specific week tracking
- `last_sync_date`: API synchronization timestamp
- `sync_frequency_minutes`: Automated sync configuration
- `is_active`: Conference status flag

## Database Service Implementation

### DatabaseService Class Methods

#### Temporal Queries
- `getCurrentRosters()`: Query current roster states with temporal optimization
- `getAvailablePlayers()`: Fast availability queries using cache
- `getPlayerRosterHistory()`: Complete player transaction history

#### Cache Management
- `updatePlayerAvailabilityCache()`: Maintain availability cache
- `updateSyncStatus()`: Track synchronization operations

#### Roster Management
- `updateTeamRoster()`: Update roster with temporal tracking
- `addRosterHistoryEntry()`: Add transaction to audit trail

#### Analytics
- `getMultiTeamOwnership()`: Cross-conference ownership analysis
- `getSyncStatus()`: Monitor synchronization health

## Performance Optimizations

### Composite Indexes
1. **team_rosters**: (season_id, week, is_current)
2. **player_availability_cache**: (season_id, week, is_available)
3. **player_roster_history**: (player_id, transaction_date)
4. **sync_status**: (sync_type, conference_id, season_id)

### Query Optimization Strategies
1. **Temporal Queries**: Use is_current flag for efficient current state queries
2. **Availability Cache**: Pre-computed availability status eliminates complex joins
3. **View Tables**: Pre-joined common queries for faster response times
4. **Batch Operations**: Grouped database operations for improved throughput

## Data Integrity Features

### Foreign Key Constraints
- All inter-table references use proper foreign key constraints
- Cascading deletes configured for data consistency
- Referential integrity enforced at database level

### Audit Trails
- Complete transaction history in player_roster_history
- Timestamp tracking on all temporal operations
- Version control for data changes

### Conflict Prevention
- Sync status tracking prevents concurrent operations
- Transaction-level locking for critical operations
- Error tracking and recovery mechanisms

## Admin Panel Integration

### Database Management Tab Features
1. **Sync Status Monitoring**: Real-time sync operation tracking
2. **Roster History Search**: Query player transaction history
3. **Cache Management**: Update and monitor availability cache
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Database performance metrics

### Sync Operations
- Manual sync triggers for different data types
- Conference-specific synchronization
- Progress tracking and error reporting
- Performance metrics collection

## Usage Examples

### Query Current Rosters
```typescript
const rosters = await DatabaseService.getCurrentRosters({
  seasonId: 2025,
  week: 13,
  conferenceId: 1
});
```

### Search Available Players
```typescript
const available = await DatabaseService.getAvailablePlayers({
  seasonId: 2025,
  position: 'RB',
  isAvailable: true
});
```

### Track Roster Changes
```typescript
await DatabaseService.updateTeamRoster({
  teamId: 123,
  playerId: 456,
  seasonId: 2025,
  week: 13,
  rosterStatus: 'active',
  isAdd: true
});
```

## Migration Considerations

### Data Migration Strategy
1. Backup existing data before schema changes
2. Migrate current rosters to new temporal structure
3. Populate historical data where available
4. Initialize cache tables with current state

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing APIs maintained during transition
- Gradual migration of queries to new structure
- Fallback mechanisms for legacy operations

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Sync status monitoring
- Cache hit rate tracking
- Query performance metrics
- Data consistency validation

### Maintenance Tasks
- Regular cache refresh operations
- Historical data archiving
- Performance index optimization
- Sync error resolution

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Admin-only access to database management features
- Audit logging for all administrative operations
- Role-based permissions for different operations

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data encryption where applicable
- Secure API key management for Sleeper integration
- Transaction logging for accountability

This enhanced database schema provides a robust foundation for The Gladiator League application with comprehensive temporal tracking, performance optimization, and administrative capabilities.
